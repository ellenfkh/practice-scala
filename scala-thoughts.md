# Mauricio Molina and Ellen Hui

## Easy things in Scala
- Recursion is pretty easy in Scala.
- It`s also easy to combine functional and more OO paradigms.
- The pattern matching is very nice.

## Favorite design choices
- The Options are confusing but also kind of nice once you get used to them.
- The hybrid-ness of it is nice, because it lets you be creative in multiple
ways, and is less restrictive than some other languages.
- The companion objects thing is a fairly reasonable way to deal with
static/class methods, once you get used to it.  We like how it explicitly
enforces a singleton object with all the static methods.

## Least-favorite design choices
- We don`t like the optional semicolons -- We want them explicit.  Having them
optional reminds us of Javascript. :(
- We don`t like the optional/implicit returns.


## Things to learn more about
- Sequences, why they`re necessary, and how to use them properly.
- thingy* inputs (variable number of arguments).
- Maps.
- How to deal with immutable objects.
- DSL-building specific functionality.
